This is a mobile application that detects potholes in real-time using a deep learning object detection model on video captured through the camera. The app estimates the
dimensions of potholes with a regression model built on data points collected from the detection model. It includes a driver alert system that warns users when the confidence in detected pothole and its dimensions exceed a pre-defined threshold. The application also saves information about the potholes,
including their location and dimensions, in a cloud database which can be used by government for maintenance purposes. The data can be visualized on a pothole map through a web application.
